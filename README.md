# **Pandas**

**Pandas** is a powerful **Python library for data manipulation and analysis.** It provides easy-to-use data structures and functions to work with structured data like tabular, time series, or matrix data.

**Pandas primarily provides two data structures: Series and DataFrame.**

**Series:** A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.

**DataFrame:** A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.
